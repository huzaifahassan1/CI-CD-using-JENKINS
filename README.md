Continuous integration and continuous deployment 
CI/CD Pipeline

Our project utilizes a robust CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery) pipeline to ensure code quality, streamlined testing, and automated deployments. Here's a breakdown of our process:<br>

**Continuous Integration:** <br> 

1.Every code change triggers a new build.<br>
2.Automated unit and integration tests are executed to catch errors early.<br>
3.Code coverage and linting checks enforce quality standards.<br>
4.Successful builds generate deployable artifacts (e.g., container images).<br>
**Continuous Delivery:** <br>

1.Artifacts from successful builds are automatically deployed to staging environments.<br>
2.Deployments undergo smoke tests and additional integration testing.<br>
3.Manual approval may be required before production deployment.<br>
**Benefits:** <br>

**Faster Releases:** Reduced manual steps lead to quicker iteration cycles<br>
**Improved Reliability:** Automated testing minimizes the risk of regressions.<br>
**Increased Confidence:** Thorough testing and quality checks boost trust in code changes.<br>
**Tools Used:** <br>
Jenkins <br>
gitlab <br>
github actions <br>
circle ci <br>
azure <br>
aws <br>
